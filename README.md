# World Happiness
#### Technologies: Python, Tableau

This project demonstrates:
- Ingesting data from different sources (flat files, database and API) 
- Consolidating multiple datasets into one masterfile (see code [here](https://github.com/cjdeguzman95/World-Happiness-Project/blob/main/World%20Happiness%20Analysis.ipynb))
- Creating a Tableau dashboard (see dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cj.de.guzman/viz/WorldHappinessDashboard_16478803702860/WorldHappiness))

This project explores data on world happiness between 2016 and 2019

The data is analysed to answer the following questions:
1. Which year was the world at its happiest?
2. How does wealth affect happiness?
3. How does quality of life affect happiness?
4. How does family structure affect happiness?
