# World-Happiness-Project

The goal of this project is to analyse world happiness in 2019

This project involved ingesting data from different data sources (flat files, database and API) which were then cleaned and transformed into one consolidated masterfile. The masterfile was then loaded into Tableau for further analysis. 

You can view the Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cj.de.guzman/viz/WorldHappinessDashboard_16478803702860/WorldHappiness).

The datasets were obtained from [Euromonitor](https://www.euromonitor.com/), [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness), [Metaweather Open API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) and [Git Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icyrockcom/country-capitals/master/data/country-list.csv)
